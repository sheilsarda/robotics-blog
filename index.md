# 🤖 Robotics Blog

I'm a robotics engineer exploring the intersection of large language models and physical manipulation. This blog documents my experiments, failures, and occasional successes in getting LLMs to control real hardware.

## About

I work on warehouse automation by day — gantries, conveyors, and mobile robots moving packages at scale. This blog is where I explore what happens when you give those systems a language interface.
